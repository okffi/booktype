How can you help
----------------

.. We need to put links to other docs which are describing other options.

It is not just about core development. We also need help with translating interface, building new book themes, helping other people on the forum or just help us write the documentation. 

Our official tracker is a good place to find already available tasks to work on - http://dev.sourcefabric.org/browse/BK.

This documentation is work in progress but it is good place where you can find out more about the project, structure, tools we use and how we organise our work.
