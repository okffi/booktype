Installing Booktype 1.6
-----------------------

There are three components to the Booktype Tool Set. This doc
covers only the Booktype (editor/book manager) component and not Espri
(importer) or Objavi (exporter). By default Booktype is hardwired to the
Sourcefabric install of Objavi and Espri so you still acquire that
functionality. To detach yourself from the Sourcefabric mothership
you need to install Espri and Objavi and configure your install of
Booki accordingly.

Find out more about Objavi and Espri: https://wiki.sourcefabric.org/display/Booktype/Objavi


Booktype Install script
-----------------------

Booktype can be installed on various Linux distributions and Mac OS X. There are no native 
packages at the moment but you can try Booktype install script:
  https://github.com/aerkalov/booktype-scrolls/tree/master/scripts/install

Be aware it will setup Booktype with Sqlite3 and biltin web server. You will have to
manually setup PostgreSQL or Apache/Nginx configuration.
